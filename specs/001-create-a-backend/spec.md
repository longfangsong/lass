# Feature Specification: DeepL Free API Integration for Active Review

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-backend`  
**Created**: 6 oktober 2025  
**Updated**: 7 oktober 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a backend API to polyfill English meanings of Swedish sentences using DeepL Free API for active review when only Swedish examples are available"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature clearly specified: API to translate Swedish example sentences to English
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Swedish learners using active review, backend API, DeepL Free API service
   ‚Üí Actions: translate Swedish sentences, store translations, retrieve during active review
   ‚Üí Data: Swedish example sentences, English translations, API responses
   ‚Üí Constraints: only when English meaning unavailable, DeepL Free API limits
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí DeepL Free API has known limits: 500,000 characters/month
   ‚Üí API key authentication already available
   ‚Üí Rate limiting: standard HTTP rate limits apply
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User encounters Swedish-only example during active review
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Translation requests, cached translations, API responses
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focused on user value, not implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A Swedish learner is doing active review exercises where they need to construct Swedish sentences. The system has many Lexeme records with Swedish `example` sentences but missing English `example_meaning` translations. The system should provide API endpoints to fill these missing English translations using DeepL Free API, improving the data quality and learning experience for all users.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a word has lexemes with `example` but no `example_meaning` **When** the translation API is called for that word **Then** all missing `example_meaning` fields are populated with English translations
2. **Given** a Swedish example sentence has been translated **When** the same sentence appears in other lexemes **Then** the system uses the cached translation without re-translating
3. **Given** a translation request fails **When** the system cannot obtain a translation **Then** the `example_meaning` field remains empty and the failure is logged
4. **Given** an admin runs batch translation **When** processing multiple lexemes **Then** the system efficiently translates all missing `example_meaning` fields across the database

### Edge Cases
- What happens when DeepL Free API is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does the system handle sentences that are too long for translation?
- What if the translation quality is poor or nonsensical?
- How does the system behave when DeepL Free API monthly character limits (500,000) are exceeded?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when Lexeme records have `example` but missing `example_meaning` fields
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide API endpoints to translate Swedish `example` text to English `example_meaning` using DeepL Free API
- **FR-003**: System MUST store successful translations permanently in the Lexeme table `example_meaning` field
- **FR-004**: System MUST cache translations to avoid re-translating identical Swedish text
- **FR-005**: System MUST continue functioning when DeepL Free API is unavailable (graceful degradation)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide translation API responses within 5 seconds
- **FR-007**: System MUST track translation requests and responses to monitor character usage against monthly limits
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle translation requests while staying within DeepL Free API monthly limit of 500,000 characters
- **FR-009**: System MUST support batch processing of multiple lexemes for data migration scenarios
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that translations are reasonable before storing (maximum 500 characters per translation)

### Key Entities
- **Translation Request**: Represents a request to translate a Swedish sentence, including the source text and request metadata
- **Cached Translation**: Stored English translation of a Swedish sentence, with creation timestamp and source information (DeepL Free API)
- **Translation Response**: Result from DeepL Free API service, including translated text and any error information
- **Character Usage Tracking**: Monthly character consumption monitoring to stay within DeepL Free API limits
