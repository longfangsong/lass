**Feature Branch**: `002-build-a-settings`  
**Created**: 7 oktober 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a settings page, which can adjust things like Theme, suggested max daily start review count, turn on review notification, etc."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: User settings configuration page
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Learners using the Swedish learning platform
   ‚Üí Actions: View, modify, save user preferences
   ‚Üí Data: Theme preference, review limits, notification settings
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must integrate with existing theme system and review logic
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Notification delivery: PWA Notifications API for browser notifications
   ‚Üí Settings storage: Local storage only, no cross-device sync
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Access settings, modify preferences, save changes
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Integration with existing UserSettings type and theme system
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Settings configurations, notification preferences
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Swedish learner using L√§ss, I want to customize my learning experience through a dedicated settings page so that I can control my study pace, preferred visual theme, and notification preferences to match my personal learning style and schedule.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged into L√§ss, **When** I navigate to the settings page, **Then** I should see all available configuration options clearly organized
2. **Given** I am on the settings page, **When** I change my theme preference from dark to light, **Then** the application should immediately reflect the new theme and persist my choice
3. **Given** I want to control my daily review workload, **When** I adjust the "max daily review start count" setting, **Then** the review system should respect this limit and not suggest more new reviews than specified
4. **Given** I want to receive study reminders, **When** I enable review notifications, **Then** the system should request notification permissions and send browser notifications when I have reviews due
5. **Given** I have made changes to my settings, **When** I save the configuration, **Then** all changes should be persisted and take effect immediately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when notification permissions are denied by the browser?
- How does the system handle browsers that don't support the Notifications API?
- How does the system handle invalid daily review count values (negative numbers, extremely large numbers)?
- What occurs if settings fail to save due to network issues?
- How are conflicting settings resolved (e.g., notifications enabled but browser permissions denied)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated settings page accessible from the main navigation
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select their preferred theme (light, dark, system)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to configure their maximum daily new review count 
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to enable/disable review notifications using PWA browser notifications
- **FR-005**: System MUST request notification permissions when user enables notifications for the first time
- **FR-006**: System MUST immediately apply theme changes without requiring page refresh
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist all settings changes to local storage
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate daily review count inputs to prevent invalid values
- **FR-009**: System MUST display current setting values when the page loads
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback when settings are saved successfully
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle settings save failures gracefully with error messages
- **FR-012**: Settings MUST integrate with existing review system logic for daily limits
- **FR-013**: System MUST gracefully handle browsers that don't support notifications API
- **FR-014**: System MUST show notification permission status to users
- **FR-015**: Settings MUST be stored locally per device without cross-device synchronization

### Key Entities
- **UserSettings**: Extends existing UserSettings interface to include theme preference and notification settings
- **NotificationPreference**: Configuration for PWA browser notification settings including permission status
- **ThemeConfiguration**: User's preferred visual theme (integrates with existing theme system)
